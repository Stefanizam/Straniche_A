            As a senior visual effects artist and graphic designer by profession, with over a decade
            of professional experience, and a concept artist and gamer by hobby, I am confident
            enough to say that I have developed a very strong affinity and knowledge of computers
            and their most intricate functions. After ascending the hierarchies of companies I have
            been employed at, I feel ready and eager to take on a new challenge.<br>
            As an employee, I would describe myself as a high performer, adaptable, with
            unrelenting focus. Whether on a supervisory or subordinate position, my pragmatic
            nature leads me to assign value to my co-workers according to merit, efficiency and
            perseverance.<br>
            I have always had a flair for automation and optimization when it comes to solving
            problems, so my current plan is to play to my strengths and expand my knowledge of
            programming languages further and move into game, software or web development.
            I am currently in the market, searching for a full-time or part-time position at any type
            of organization, but I also welcome opportunities as a consultant or freelancer.

                    While starting off as a hobbyist, primarily focused on concept art and matte painting, a job
                    opportunity presented itself at FX3X, which required that I shift my focus to VFX compositing.<br>
                    At FX3X I was given the means and resources to expand my abilities and with the help and mentorship
                    of Zoran Dimanovski, one of the companyâ€™s most valued lead artists, I was able to become a fully
                    fledged VFX paint and compositing artist with nearly six years of experience in the film
                    industry.<br><br>
                    My portfolio now includes over forty, full feature films and popular TV shows, such as: Thor:
                    Ragnarok,
                    Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider man: Homecoming, Batman v Superman: Dawn of
                    Justice, Star Wars - The Last Jedi & The Rise of Skywalker, Alien: Covenant, X-Men: Apocalypse,
                    Mission Impossible - Fallout, Ghost in the Shell, Star Trek: Discovery, etc.
